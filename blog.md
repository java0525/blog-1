## Introduction

In the realm of software development, the efficiency of setting up new projects is very important.
This post introduces a shell script designed to streamline the creation of a basic project structure,
enhancing productivity by automating initial setup tasks.

## The Script at a Glance

The script simplifies the process of starting a new project by automatically creating a project directory with essential subdirectories and files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It initializes a Git repository and sets up a `.gitignore` file, opening the project in the default editor for immediate development.

### Running the Script

1.  Save the script as `blog-1.sh`.
2.  Make it executable with `chmod +x blog-1.sh`.
3.  Execute with your project name like `./blog-1.sh MyProject`.


## Script Overview
1. Check for Arguments: Ensure the user provides a project name when running the script.
2. Create Project Directory: Use the provided name to create a new directory for the project.
3. Set Up Basic Files and Directories: Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files along with any other directories needed.
4. Add Boilerplate Code: Include basic starter code in these files.
5. Perform Simple Tests: Check if CSS and JavaScript files are linked correctly in the HTML file.
6. Open Project Files: Open the main files in the default editor to start working immediately.

## Gained Knowledge and Its Applications
Developing this script not only streamlined my project setup process but also deepened my understanding of shell scripting and automation. This knowledge is invaluable for automating other aspects of development workflows, improving efficiency, and ensuring consistency.

## Conclusion

This shell script aims to eliminate the repetitive manual setup tasks, ensuring consistency and saving time, allowing developers to focus more on the creative side of their projects.
