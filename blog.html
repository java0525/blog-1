<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the realm of software development, the efficiency of setting up new projects is very important.
  This post introduces a shell script designed to streamline the creation of a basic project structure,
  enhancing productivity by automating initial setup tasks.</p>
<h2 id="the-script-at-a-glance">The Script at a Glance</h2>
<p>The script simplifies the process of starting a new project by automatically creating a project directory with essential subdirectories and files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It initializes a Git repository and sets up a <code>.gitignore</code>
  file, opening the project in the default editor for immediate development.</p>
<h3 id="running-the-script">Running the Script</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Save the script as <code>blog-1.sh</code>.</li>
  <li>Make it executable with <code>chmod +x blog-1.sh</code>.</li>
  <li>Execute with your project name like <code>./blog-1.sh MyProject</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="script-overview">Script Overview</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Check for Arguments: Ensure the user provides a project name when running the script.</li>
